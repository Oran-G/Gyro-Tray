											<p>Freshman year, we ideated and built an initial gyrotray prototype. This was a great proof of concept, but the tray was fragile, bulky, and was not nearly as stable as we had hoped.</p>

										<p>Sophomore year, we continued to prototype. Due to COVID-19 Restrictions on lab access, we did not get as far as we would have liked, and were left with underpowered servos and inadequete stabilization.</p>

										<p>In short, no. We have two companies shortlisted that we believe partnering with accelerate our growth and be useful to our project - PlantEdit and Sherlock Biosciences.</p>

									<a class="toggle-title">What is PlantEdit?</a>
									<div class="toggle-content">
										<p>Plant Edit is an Ireland-based CRISPR startup company aiming to produce “DNA-free” non-transgenic sustainable plant products in an attempt to introduce genome editing to food supply enhancement in a regulatory-free manner. The company focuses on creating modified plants that do not contain any foreign genetic material with a goal to meet the ever-increasing demand for “designer” crops while circumventing both the general aversion to ingesting non-plant-based DNA or RNA and the regulatory fences around traditional “GMO.”</p>
										<p>They’ve also created a CRISPR-Cas9-modified soybean with a high oil content named SOlive. This oil is similar to olive oil, but can be used to fry food products at higher temperatures and store fried products for longer periods of time. The company is currently also developing enhanced fruit products and turf grass with the hopes of generating next-generation sustainable foods. Their expertise would be extremely useful in helping us edit the genome of the trees, having had industry experience with CRISPR.</p>

								<section class="toggle">
									<a class="toggle-title">What is Sherlock Biosciences?</a>
									<div class="toggle-content">
										<p>Biology company dedicated to making diagnostic testing better, faster, and more affordable. This company has been using engineered tools of biology like CRISPR and Synthetic Biology to create molecular diagnostics, which can rapidly deliver accurate and inexpensive results for a vast range of needs in virtually any setting. And it uses SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) technology to detect genetic fingerprints across multiple organisms or sample types.</p>
										<p>It is also looking to develop INSPECTR (Internal Splint-Pairing Expression Cassette Translation Reaction), a Synthetic Biology-based molecular diagnostics. Thus, this would open a wide range of potential applications in areas including oncology, infection identification, at-home testing, and disease detection in the field. Their genetic fingerprinting technology and rapid genome analysis tools will be incredibly advantageous in our editing process.</p>

									<a class="toggle-title">Why is the Amazon Rainforest your first target? </a>
									<div class="toggle-content">
										<p>Rainforests are the hardest ecosystems to revitalize after being deforested. This is because their ecosystem is always in a very sensitive balance. When all the trees are removed, the soil erodes. When soil erodes, it becomes unsustainable for normal trees to plant and regrow in it for a multitude of reasons. The most prominent of these reasons is the lack of nutritional value in the soil, therefore the tree simply can’t sustain itself in that harsh condition. The Amazon Rainforest has been deforested to a great degree and alone it is responsible for a tremendous 6% of the world’s oxygen.</p>

								<section class="toggle">
									<a class="toggle-title">How is this a moonshot project?</a>
									<div class="toggle-content">
										<p>Tree genome sequencing hasn’t been explored much, with only 25 species from 4 of 100 families of trees being fully genomically sequenced. Also, CRISPR for Directed Evolution has hardly been explored beyond surface level. We believe that, with tree genome sequencing projects, an increase in CRISPR research, and simpler rapid genome sequencing tools, our idea will become feasible within the next 5-8 years.<p>
